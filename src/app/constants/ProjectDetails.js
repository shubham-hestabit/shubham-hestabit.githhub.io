                are then uploaded to our platform. Our platform processes these 
                images to create a seamless 360-degree video, offering immersive
                panoramic views of the captured space. Users have the option to 
                view the resulting video either in its standard format or with 
                Lidar technology enabled. With Lidar functionality, users gain 
                the ability to precisely measure objects within the lidar video, 
                enhancing the platform's utility for various applications such as
                spatial analysis, construction planning, and environmental monitoring.
                This comprehensive solution empowers users to explore and analyze 
                spatial data with unparalleled accuracy and details.`

                with their corresponding information. Users can interact with a ChatBot
                to inquire about specific brands, receiving relevant answers promptly. 
                Additionally, users have the option to express their satisfaction by 
                liking or disliking the responses provided by the ChatBot To ensure 
                seamless communication and address any queries effectively, we've 
                implemented an Admin panel. Through this panel, administrators can 
                oversee all incoming questions from users and promptly respond to them. 
                This feature enhances user engagement and satisfaction while facilitating
                efficient management of user inquiries.`

                to view the comprehensive details of contacts affiliated with these
                firms and organizations. This subscription-based model ensures that
                users have the necessary authorization to access sensitive information,

                and User. The Admin role encompasses the privilege to complete the 
                form template, incorporate new users into the system, and establish 
                default values for the data within the form. Conversely, Users are 
                restricted to filling out predefined form templates. Subsequently, 
                our platform undertakes the crucial task of comparing the inputted 
                form values, ensuring consistency and accuracy across submissions.`
